## Overview

Millis AI supports WebRTC integration, allowing users to connect their audio sources directly to Millis agents via WebRTC. This integration is ideal for a variety of applications, including:
- **Phone systems** with WebRTC capabilities
- **Voice agents in video conferencing platforms** (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet) to interact with participants via voice
- **VoIP systems** that leverage WebRTC for real-time communication

Millis AI enables users to build intelligent voice agents that can join these platforms, engage in conversations, and assist participants via voice interactions.

## Requirements

To connect your phone system, video conferencing platform, or VoIP solution to Millis AI via WebRTC, ensure that:
1. Your system supports **WebRTC** for audio transmission.
2. You have a valid **agent_id** to route calls or streams to the correct Millis agent.
3. You have a **private key** for authenticating requests to Millis.

## API Endpoint

To initiate a WebRTC session, your system sends a WebRTC **offer** to Millis through the following API endpoint:

### **POST /webrtc/offer**

This API is used to send the WebRTC offer to Millis, where it will be processed, and a WebRTC **answer** will be returned to complete the connection.

### Request Headers:
- **Authorization**: Bearer token containing the **private key** to authenticate the request.
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`

### Request Body:
The request body contains the following fields:

| Field     | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `agent_id`| String | The ID of the Millis agent to handle the call or stream.                     |
| `offer`   | Object | The WebRTC offer details, containing `sdp` and `type`.                       |

#### `offer` Object:
| Field     | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sdp`     | String | The WebRTC offer's session description protocol (SDP).                       |
| `type`    | String | Type of the WebRTC request (typically "offer").                              |

#### Example Request:
```json
{
  "agent_id": "123456",
  "offer": {
    "sdp": "v=0\no=- 2566784789543948235 2 IN IP4 127.0.0.1...",
    "type": "offer"
  }
}
```

### Example cURL Command:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api-west.millis.ai/webrtc/offer \
  -H "Authorization: <your-private-key-here>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "123456",
    "offer": {
      "sdp": "v=0\no=- 2566784789543948235 2 IN IP4 127.0.0.1...",
      "type": "offer"
    }
  }'
```

### Response:
If the offer is valid, the API will respond with a WebRTC **answer** that can be used to complete the connection between your system and Millis.

#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "answer": {
    "sdp": "v=0\no=- 9876543210987654321 2 IN IP4 127.0.0.1...",
    "type": "answer"
  }
}
```

### Establish connection and start streaming:

1. **Set the Remote Description**: Use the `sdp` from the answer to set the remote description on your WebRTC client.
   - Example (JavaScript/WebRTC):
     ```javascript
     peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription({
       type: 'answer',
       sdp: 'v=0\no=- 9876543210987654321 2 IN IP4 127.0.0.1...'
     }));
     ```

2. **Complete ICE Candidate Exchange**: Ensure that ICE candidates are exchanged between your client and Millis to establish the media path.

3. **Start Media Transmission**: After completing SDP and ICE negotiations, audio will start flowing between your system and the Millis agent.

## Use Cases

### 1. **Phone Systems with SIP and WebRTC**
   - Route incoming calls from DID numbers through Millis AI for real-time voice interaction, using WebRTC for media transmission.

### 2. **Voice Agents in Video Conferencing Tools**
   - Connect voice agents to video conferencing platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, and others. The voice agent can join calls and engage in real-time audio conversations with participants, providing support, answering questions, or automating workflows.

### 3. **Connecting Agents to Virtual Rooms**
   - Millis agents can be connected to virtual communication rooms via WebRTC, interacting with users in the room to provide assistance, answer questions, or drive conversations through audio.
