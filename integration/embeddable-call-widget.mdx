Millis AI offers a simple and effective way to integrate voice interaction into your web applications through our embeddable call widget. This widget allows users to interact with your voice agent directly from your website, providing a seamless user experience.

The widget includes a button to start and stop interactions and features an animation of an audiogram to visually represent the audio interaction similar to our demo page.

## Adding Metadata via URL Parameters

You can customize each widget session by adding URL parameters that will be passed as metadata. This allows you to provide context-specific information to your voice agent.

### Example Usage

You can add metadata parameters like this:

```html
https://app.millis.ai/agents/embedded?id=XXXX&k=YYYYYY&userName=John&userType=premium
```

These parameters will be automatically converted into metadata for the session, allowing your agent to access this information during the conversation. You can reference this metadata using [variables](/core-concepts/variables) in your agent's prompts or function calls.

### Common Use Cases

- Adding user identification information
- Passing context about the page or section where the widget is embedded
- Providing custom configuration parameters for the conversation

<Tip>
Remember that any metadata added via URL parameters will be visible in the URL. Don't include sensitive information this way.
