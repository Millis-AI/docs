Millis AIâ€™s Session Continuation feature enables agents to leverage previous interaction data, allowing users to continue conversations seamlessly from prior sessions. By passing a `session_id`, agents can access past context, enhancing engagement and providing a personalized experience for users.

---

## Important Note on Data Opt-Out

**Warning**: Session Continuation is only available if **Data Opt-Out is disabled**.
When Data Opt-Out is enabled, Millis does not retain call history, so agent can't retrieve data from previous sessions. Ensure that Data Opt-Out is disabled if you require session continuation for your users.

## How to Pass `session_id` for Session Continuation

### 1. **Web SDK Integration**
To enable session continuation using the Millis Web SDK, use the `msClient.start` method:

```javascript
msClient.start({
  agent: {
    agent_id: agentId
  },
  session_continuation: {
    session_id: "<previous session id>"
  }
});
```

### 2. **Native Integration via WebSocket**
To continue a session via WebSocket, include the `session_id` in the `initiate` event:

```json
{
  "method": "initiate",
  "data": {
    "agent": {
      "agent_id": "your_agent_id",
      // or for dynamic configuration
      "agent_config": "<config>"
    },
    "public_key": "your_public_key",
    "metadata": {
      "key": "value"
    },
    "include_metadata_in_prompt": true,
    "session_continuation": {
      "session_id": "<previous session id>"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 3. **Outbound Call API Integration**
For outbound calls, the `session_id` is included in the request body when calling the `start_outbound_call` API.

#### Example Request
```json
{
  "from_phone": "your_agent_phone_number",
  "to_phone": "receiver_phone_number",
  "metadata": {
    "key": "value"
  },
  "include_metadata_in_prompt": true,
  "session_continuation": {
    "session_id": "<previous session id>"
  }
}
```

## Example Scenarios

1. **Follow-Up Customer Support Calls**: A returning customer can pick up from a previous conversation by including the `session_id`, reducing the need to re-explain their issue.
2. **Ongoing Campaigns**: In multi-stage campaigns, `session_id` helps track each caller's journey, creating a more cohesive experience.
3. **Consultations**: Advisors can use session continuation to reference past discussions, fostering a more personalized relationship.

## Future Enhancements
- **User Identification:** Upcoming features will allow sessions to continue based on `user_id`, `phone`, or similar identifiers, adding memory across sessions without requiring a `session_id`.
