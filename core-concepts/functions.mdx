## Function Types:

#### API Webhooks

These allow the agent to perform actions or retrieve information during a conversation by calling external APIs. This is useful for tasks like booking appointments, fetching user-specific data, or updating records in real-time.

#### Web Form Trigger

Implement a function where the agent can prompt users to fill out a web form during a conversation. This is particularly useful for gathering detailed information or when textual input is more practical than voice. For example: Email, phone number, name, etc.

## Understanding Function Structure

### Webhook Function

Webhook functions include the following components:

```typescript
interface FunctionCall { // Main structure for defining a function.
  name: string;           // Function name, formatted as a valid identifier (no spaces, begins with a letter)
  description: string;    // Detailed description to help the agent understand when to use the function
  webhook: string;        // The URL of the webhook to which the request will be sent
  header: object;         // Any necessary headers for the webhook request
  params: Param[];        // Array of `Param` objects, defining the parameters needed by the function
}

interface Param {
  name: string;           // Valid parameter name, no spaces, starts with a letter, can use underscores or camelCase
  type: ParamType;        // The data type of the parameter (e.g., string, number, boolean)
  description: string;    // Detailed description of the parameter
  required: boolean;      // Whether this parameter is mandatory
}
```

<Tip>
- **Function and Parameter Naming**: Ensure that the function name and parameter names are formatted as valid identifiers. They should have no spaces, begin with a letter, and can include underscores or use camelCase, such as "get_email" or "getEmail".
- **Descriptions** Provide comprehensive details in your function and parameter descriptions to help the agent understand what the function is for and when to use it.

### Web Form Function

Web form functions allow your voice agent to trigger web forms on browser during conversation for data collection or user input. This is particularly useful for gathering detailed information or when textual input is more practical than voice. For example: Email, phone number, name, etc.

```json
export interface WebFormFunction {
  name: string;                   // Function name, formatted as a valid identifier
  description: string;            // Detailed description to help the agent understand the function's purpose
  type: "web_form";               // Specify this as 'web_form' for web form functions
  data: {                         // Define the parameter to collect from the web form
    param: Param;
  };
}
```

## Example

```json
// Webhook
{
  name: "getUserInfo",
  description: "Retrieves user information from the database using their email.",
  webhook: "https://api.example.com/user",
  header: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer your_access_token"
  },
  params: [
    {
      name: "email",
      type: "string",
      description: "The user's email that you collect during the conversation.",
      required: true
    }
  ]
};

// Web Form
{
  name: "open_email_form",
  description: "Trigger a web form for user to enter contact details.",
  type: "web_form",
  data: {
    param: {
      name: "email",
      type: "string",
      description: "Collect user's email info.",
      required: true
    }
  }
};
```

Once you have defined your function, you can integrate it into your agentâ€™s configuration. Add the function to the tools array in your agent config.

```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      name: "getUserInfo",
      // the rest of the function definition
    }
  ]
}
```
