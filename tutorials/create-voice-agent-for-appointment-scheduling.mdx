## Step 1

Begin by setting the groundwork for creating a voice agent on Millis AI. This agent will manage calendar availability and booking appointments, a common use case. Currently, there is integration with cal.com, a booking management software.

## Step 2

We plan to integrate more services in the future, such as calendly.com and Google Calendar. Start by setting the time zone for your agent.

## Step 3

This time zone setting ensures that when the agent books a date and time, it will use this local time zone.

## Step 4

Next, add a feature called app function. This feature allows integration with third-party services. For booking appointments, we will use cal.com as our integration.

## Step 5

For cal.com, there are two actions you can enable for the agent: one is returning available meeting slots, and the other is booking a meeting slot.

## Step 6

It is advisable to enable both actions for your agent.

## Step 9

Ensure you set the availability. Once done, look at the URL to find event types followed by some ID.

This ID is the event type ID. Copy and paste it into the event type ID field.

## Step 16

Select the user contact method. If the agent will manage bookings over the phone, it's advisable to choose the phone contact method.

Choose phone as the contact method if applicable.

## Step 18

By selecting this option, the user's calling phone number will be captured and saved into the booking event. You will need to provide your own email for sending the booking confirmations.

## Step 19

This allows you to keep track of the bookings.

## Step 21

Another option for contact is via email.

## Step 22

For web agents or phone agents where you prefer the user to provide their email for booking confirmations, select the email option. During the conversation, the agent will prompt the user for their email.

## Step 23

Once the user provides their email, both you and the user will receive the booking confirmation.
