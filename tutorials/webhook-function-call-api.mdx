This tutorial will guide you through setting up a simple webhook function that calls an API to retrieve informationâ€”specifically, the latest news based on a keyword using NewsAPI. Before you begin, make sure you have an account with NewsAPI and obtain your API key.

### Define the Webhook Function

Start by defining a `FunctionCall` for your webhook function via the Playground or our APIs. You'll need to specify the name, description, webhook URL, headers, and parameters required to make the API call.

Example function definition:

```json
{
  name: "get_latest_news",
  description: "Fetch the latest news based on a keyword.",
  webhook: "https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?pageSize=1",
  header: {
    "Authorization": "<your news api key>"
  },
  params: [
    {
      name: "q", // use the exact parameter that the newsapi api requires
      type: "string",
      description: "The keyword to search for news.",
      required: true
    }
  ]
}
```

To test the function, simply prompt the agent to tell you about the latest news on "some keyword".
