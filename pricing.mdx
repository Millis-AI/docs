title: Millis AI Pricing Overview
description: 'A breakdown of how our pricing works'
---

At Millis AI, we designed our pricing to be transparent and straightforward. Here's a breakdown of how our pricing works, including the costs associated with using different Large Language Models (LLMs), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Speech-to-Text (STT) providers.

## Price Breakdown

### Base Charge

We charge a base rate of **$0.02** per minute for using the Millis AI platform. This rate is in addition to the fees charged by other providers such as LLM, TTS, and STT services.

### LLM Model Pricing

The pricing for LLMs is based on the number of tokens processed. Here, we translate token-based pricing into an estimated cost per minute based on typical usage:

* **GPT-4o**:
  * Input: $5.00 per 1 million tokens
  * Output: $15.00 per 1 million tokens
  * Estimated costs per minute: $0.004 per minute
* **GPT-4 Turbo**:
  * Input: $10.00 per 1 million tokens
  * Output: $30.00 per 1 million tokens
  * Estimated costs per minute: $0.008 per minute
* **GPT-3.5 Turbo**:
  * Input: $0.50 per 1 million tokens
  * Output: $1.50 per 1 million tokens
  * Estimated costs per minute: $0.0004 per minute
* **Meta Llama-3**:
  * Input: $0.90 per 1 million tokens
  * Output: $0.90 per 1 million tokens
  * Estimated costs per minute: $0.00018 per minute
* **Your LLM**: No charge for using your own custom LLM
* **Choose By Millis - Optimize for Best Latency**:
  * Millis automatically selects the best available LLM model from above with the lowest latency for your specific configuration and functions.
  * This option is perfect for users looking for the most efficient performance without the need to manually switch between models.

### TTS Provider Pricing

TTS pricing is based on the number of characters or words that the agent speaks. This means longer responses from your agent will cost more. Each provider has its own pricing structure:

* **Eleven Labs**: $$0.15 / 1,000 characters (~ $0.12/min based on average speech length)
* **OpenAI**: $$0.015 / 1,000 characters (~ $0.012/min)
* **Rime**: $$0.075 / 1,000 characters (~ $0.06/min)

*A typical minute of voice interaction might involve processing around 200 tokens (800 characters).*

### STT Pricing

For converting spoken inputs into text, we charge **$0.0043** per minute.

## Example Calculation
Let's calculate the total cost for a 10-minute session using GPT-4o and Eleven Labs TTS, with an average speech rate. Assuming each party speaks for approximately 5 minutes during the 10-minute session:

- **Millis AI base charge**: 10 min x $0.02/min = $0.20
- **GPT-4o LLM charge**: 10 min x $0.004/min = $0.04
- **Eleven Labs TTS charge**:
Since the agent only speaks for about half of the session (5 minutes), and assuming an average speech rate translates to 4,000 characters spoken by the agent:
  - 4,000 characters x $0.15/1,000 characters = $0.60
- **STT charge**:
Since the human also speaks for approximately half of the session (5 minutes):
  - 5 minutes x $0.0043/min = $0.0215
- **Total cost**: $0.20 (base) + $0.04 (LLM) + $0.60 (TTS) + $0.0215 (STT) = $0.8615
