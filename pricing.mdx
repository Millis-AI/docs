title: Millis AI Pricing Overview
description: 'A breakdown of how our pricing works'
---

At Millis AI, we designed our pricing to be transparent and straightforward. Here's a breakdown of how our pricing works, including the costs associated with using different Large Language Models (LLMs), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Speech-to-Text (STT) providers.

## Price Breakdown

### Base Charge

We charge a base rate of **$0.02** per minute for using the Millis AI platform. This rate is in addition to the fees charged by other providers such as LLM, TTS, and STT services.

### LLM Model Pricing

The pricing for LLMs is based on the number of tokens processed. Here, we translate token-based pricing into an estimated cost per minute based on typical usage:

* **GPT-4o**:
  * Input: $5.00 per 1 million tokens
  * Output: $15.00 per 1 million tokens
  * Estimated costs per minute: $0.010 per minute
* **GPT-4 Turbo**:
  * Input: $10.00 per 1 million tokens
  * Output: $30.00 per 1 million tokens
  * Estimated costs per minute: $0.020 per minute
* **GPT-3.5 Turbo**:
  * Input: $0.50 per 1 million tokens
  * Output: $1.50 per 1 million tokens
  * Estimated costs per minute: $0.001 per minute
* **Your LLM**: No charge for using your own custom LLM

### TTS Provider Pricing

TTS pricing is based on the number of characters or words that the agent speaks. This means longer responses from your agent will cost more. Each provider has its own pricing structure:

* **Eleven Labs**: $$0.15 / 1,000 characters (~ $0.12/min based on average speech length)
* **OpenAI**: $$0.015 / 1,000 characters (~ $0.012/min)
* **Rime**: $$0.075 / 1,000 characters (~ $0.06/min)

*A typical minute of voice interaction might involve processing around 500 tokens (2000 characters).*

### STT Pricing

For converting spoken inputs into text, we charge **$0.0043** per minute.

## Example Calculation
Let's calculate the total cost for a 10-minute session using GPT-4o and Eleven Labs TTS, with an average speech rate:

- Millis AI base charge: 10 min x $0.02/min = $0.20
- GPT-4o LLM charge: 10 min x $0.010/min = $0.10
- Eleven Labs TTS charge: 2,000 characters x $0.15/1,000 characters = $0.30
- STT charge: 10 min x $0.0043/min = $0.043
- Total cost: $0.20 (base) + $0.10 (LLM) + $0.30 (TTS) + $0.043 (STT) = $0.643
