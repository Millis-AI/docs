## Basic

This feature allows you to automatically make calls to a list of contacts while Millis handles the scheduling and scaling.

#### Prerequisites

- Navigate to [Millis AI Playground](https://app.millis.ai/campaigns)
- Ensure you have at least one configured voice agent
- Have your contact list ready (CSV file or manual entries)

## Creating a Campaign



## Managing Campaigns

### Start Campaign

1. Review your campaign settings and contact list
2. Click "Start Campaign" to begin outbound calls
3. Millis will automatically:
   - Schedule calls right away
   - Scale calls based on available capacity
   - Handle retry attempts for failed calls

### Monitor Progress

Track your campaign performance in real-time:
- Total calls made
- Success rate
- Average call duration
- Call recordings
- Campaign analytics

### Pause and Resume

- Use "Pause Campaign" to temporarily halt calls
- Use "Start Campaign" again to resume the campaign

<Note>
Stopped campaigns cannot be resumed. You'll need to create a new campaign if you want to restart calls.
</Note>

## Best Practices

1. Test your campaign with a small list first
2. Ensure compliance with local calling regulations
3. Utilize the end of call webhook to monitor call quality and agent performance
